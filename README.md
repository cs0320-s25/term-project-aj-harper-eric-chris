# MimicCaptcha (Frontend Mockup)

A frontend-only mockup of a multi-modal CAPTCHA system based on human mimicry capabilities. This version demonstrates the user interface and interaction flow without actual backend processing or machine learning.

## Features in this Mockup

### Audio Mimicry Mode

- Simulates playing an audio pattern
- Provides a visual interface for users to mimic the pattern
- Shows simulated waveform visualization
- Demonstrates the complete interaction flow with mocked verification

### Facial Expression Mimicry Mode

- Displays a sequence of facial expressions (e.g., neutral → surprise → smile)
- Simulates webcam integration
- Provides visual feedback on detected expressions
- Shows the complete verification flow

## Frontend Technologies

- Next.js (React framework)
- TypeScript
- Framer Motion (for animations)
- Web Audio API (for audio generation)
- TailwindCSS (for styling)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Implementation Notes

This is a frontend-only mockup that demonstrates the user interface and interaction flow. The actual verification logic has been replaced with simulated responses for demonstration purposes. In a production implementation, you would need to:

1. Implement actual audio processing using Web Audio API and pattern matching algorithms
2. Add facial expression detection using TensorFlow.js or a similar library
3. Add server-side verification for additional security
4. Implement more sophisticated replay attack prevention
5. Further refine the UI/UX for accessibility
